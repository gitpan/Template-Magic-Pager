Template-Magic-Pager Latest Versions Changes

Version 1.15
- Removed the internal use of lvalue assigments incompatible with
  the perl-bug #17663 (Perl 5 Debugger doesn't handle properly lvalue
  sub assignment)
  
Version 1.14
- Maintainance release. A few minor changes

Version 1.13
- Removed the - now outdated - note in the Makefile.PL
- Minor change in the deprecated Template::Magic::Slicer

Version 1.12
- Added a note in the Makefile.PL

Version 1.11
- Eliminated version check and installation feedback system
  ("phone home" opt-out) from Makefile.PL to make Randal L Schwartz happy :-)
  and sad the author :-(

Version 1.1
- WARNING! The page_rows MUST be passed as an argument to the new() method!
  This could break your old code, although it is extremely simple to modify
  it. Sorry for the change (needed to reduce the two modules to just one).
- Deprecated template::Magic::Slicer. You should use Template::Magic::Pager
  instead

Version 1.0
- First release
