Template-Magic-Pager Latest Versions Changes


Version 1.12
- Added a note in the Makefile.PL

Version 1.11
- Eliminated version check and installation feedback system
  ("phone home" opt-out) from Makefile.PL to make Randal L Schwartz happy :-)
  and sad the author :-(

Version 1.1
- WARNING! The page_rows MUST be passed as an argument to the new() method!
  This could break your old code, although it is extremely simple to modify
  it. Sorry for the change (needed to reduce the two modules to just one).
- Deprecated template::Magic::Slicer. You should use Template::Magic::Pager
  instead

Version 1.0
- First release
